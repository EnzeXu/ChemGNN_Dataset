# 1. Introduction

[//]: # (The datasets are used for the Chemical Environment Graph Neural Network &#40;ChemGNN&#41;, designed to accelerate materials property prediction and advance new materials discovery. Graphitic carbon nitride &#40;g-C3N4&#41; and its doped variants have gained significant interest for their potential as optical materials. Accurate prediction of their band gaps is crucial for practical applications, however, traditional quantum simulation methods are computationally expensive and challenging to explore the vast space of possible doped molecular structures. The proposed ChemGNN leverages the learning ability of current graph neural networks &#40;GNNs&#41; to satisfactorily capture the characteristics of atoms' local chemical environment underlying complex molecular structures. Our benchmark results demonstrate more than 100% improvement in band gap prediction accuracy over existing GNNs on g-C3N4. Furthermore, the general ChemGNN model can precisely foresee band gaps of various doped g-C3N4 structures, making it a valuable tool for performing high-throughput prediction in materials design and development. )

The datasets were used to develop the Chemical Environment Graph Neural Network (ChemGNN), designed to accelerate material property prediction and to advance the discovery of new materials. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and its doped variants are of great interest for their potential applications as novel photochemical materials. As a result, the accurate prediction of their band gaps is highly desired. Nevertheless, quantum chemistry simulation methods are computationally demanding when exploring the vast chemical space to design functional doped materials. Our proposed ChemGNN leverages the learning ability of current graph neural networks (GNNs) to satisfactorily capture the characteristics of local atomic chemical environments underlying complex molecular structures. Our benchmark results demonstrate over 100% improvement in band gap prediction accuracy over existing GNNs on g-C3N4. Furthermore, this powerful ChemGNN model can precisely foresee a wide range of chemical properties of various doped g-C3N4 structures, making it a valuable tool for high-throughput screening in materials discovery.
